# The RPG Language

A guide to the [RPG programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_RPG) for the modern programmer.

This repo is intended to be a comprehensive introduction to the language. Some knowledge about [IBM I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_i) and [IBM I project explorer](https://ibm.github.io/vscode-ibmi-projectexplorer/#/) is recommended.

You can check my two repos for some context: [IBM i operating system](https://github.com/kraudy/ibmi_os) and [IBM-i-pipeline](https://github.com/kraudy/IBM-i-pipeline)

As our source material, we will be using the incredible red book [Who Knew You Could Do That with RPG IV? Modern RPG for the Modern Programmer](https://www.redbooks.ibm.com/redbooks/pdfs/sg245402.pdf)

# Context

The RPG language has been moving the financial sector in the shadows for a long time, similar to [COBOL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COBOL). They are both old school languages, but don't let that fool you; they are also modern languages, and now, more than ever, more developers are needed that understand these languages. 

All the old programmers are retiring, and new young blood is needed not only to keep the banking system around the world moving but also to modernize these legacy systems and take them to a whole new level that has never been seen before, leveraging new and open-source technology on these paleolithic business processes. 

This is the purpose of this repo, to bring more new developers into the RPG/IBM world.
